    <h2><u>the hackers : introduction</u></h2>
    <p>
        * There are various definitions one can get to know about hackers. The term hacker was used in the early 1990s and it was to describe someone who could be a great programmer and had the ability to solve complex problems. Now the definition of the hacker changed from time to time as it started to gain a negative vibe by the media. 
    </p>

<p>
    * The media started to refer to this hacker as someone who finds loopholes and tries to gain access into the system to steal information that could be important for the victims. This was the picture created by the media to only show the negative aspect, but they didnâ€™t show the positive aspect. The positive aspect was someone who was exposing the vulnerabilities found in the system and protecting organizations and multiple users.
